SETTING UP THE APP
   I used express for the setting and i also connected to the mongoose database since I'm much more familiar with that. I created an indexmodel which contains the backbone of whatever data i'd be passing into a given location.  I then used the index page to high the tasks i can perform on whatever location data had been passed. The index controller contains the main code for which each task is carried out.

TOOLS USED
 npm, nodemon , express and mongoose

 AREAS NEEDING ATTENTION
  i was able to complete my work but the calculation of distance has a slight problem. Not really a problem though. I was able to write the code to calculate the location. I just couldnt bring the coordinates of the data i needed from the database.

  I WAS ABLE TO FINISH THE FINAL PHASE TASK

  NOTE: While doing my work, i made sure i followed the steps our previous tutor "Mr Victor Ukok" laid down. I don't know if others followed the same steps though
